                                FreePost was developed by Lucas, as know as Rui Zheng in Feb. 10th, 2023. Most of my friends call me Lucas, and it was made by my first English teacher. R.Z. is my real name, but I don't like others call me this name, due to the pronounce by using English. I am studying for my postgraduate in the University of Aberdeen, which is a beautiful college in Scotland, UK. And here is my first web page. Hope you enjoy it. Cheers!

                            A wiki is an online hypertext publication collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience, using a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages for the subjects or scope of the project, and could be either open to the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base.
                            Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines. A wiki engine, being a form of a content management system, differs from other web-based systems such as blog software, in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are free and open-source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.
                            The online encyclopedia project Wikipedia is the most popular wiki-based website, and is one of the most widely viewed sites in the world, having been ranked in the top twenty since 2007. Wikipedia is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds of wikis, with each one pertaining to a specific language. The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection of articles: as of February 2020, it has over 6 million articles.
